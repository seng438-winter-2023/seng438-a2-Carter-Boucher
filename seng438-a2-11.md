# 1. Introduction

For lab 2 we implemendted unit test suites for two files in the JFreeChart Library. Through this lab we learned proper java documentation and practice to create test cases with Junit. Another key aspect to the lab was reading and understanding JavaDoc. 

note: java test files in are in JFreeChart/src/org/jfree/data/test

# 2. Detailed description of unit test strategy

__Range Class Testing__

We aim to conduct functional testing, which is essentially checking correct functionality of a system to ensure that it works as expected. Out of the testing methods discussed in class, which are exhaustive testing, random testing, and partitioning, we will be focusing on partitioning through unit tests. As such, we will be employing black-box test-case design techniques such as equivalence partitioning and boundary-value analyses for different functions.

For Range, we are testing the following methods: 

 - Intersect
 - Contains
 - Equals
 - ExpandToInclude
 - Constrain

__Boundary-Value Analysis Method:__
   - Intersect: Our plan to test this method is to test the boundary between an intersection if two ranges just touch each other. Ex. One ranges lower = other ranges upper.
   - Contains: Our plan to test this method is to test the boundary between equivalence partitions that are clearly contained and not contained with a value just at the range boundary.
Ex. Value = Range.lower or Value = Range.upper
   - ExpandToInclude: We tested the boundary between the equivalence partitions that are clearly outside of range from lower and upper bound and inside the range.

__Equivalence Partitioning Analysis Method__
1. Equals: We chose the equivalence partitioning analysis for the equals method because the equals method contains 4 equivalence classes: 
    - True: Lower boundary = lower boundary, and upper boundary = upper boundary
    - False: Lower boundary != lower boundary, and upper boundary = upper boundary
    - False: Lower boundary = lower boundary, and upper boundary != upper boundary
    - False: Lower boundary != lower boundary, and upper boundary != upper boundary
2. Constrain: We used equivalence partitioning analysis for the constrain method by setting the partitions as follows:
    - Testing return value = lower boundary when value is out of lower range.
    - Testing return value = upper boundary when value is out of upper range.
    - Testing return value = value when value is in range.
3. ExpandToInclude: We used equivalence partitioning analysis for this method by setting the partitions as follows:
    - Testing lower boundary = value when value is out of lower range.
    - Testing upper boundary = value when value is out of upper range.
    - Testing upper boundary = upper boundary and lower boundary = lower boundary when value is in the range.


Test plan:

To start, we will delve into the Java documentation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the DataUtilities and Range classes and their respective methods. After we have a solid grasp of these classes, we will move forward with the planning and creation of our test cases. Out of the 5 methods in the DataUtilities class, we will select 5 to be tested. If any method requires additional testing to thoroughly assess its behavior, we will add extra tests accordingly. For the Range class, we will choose 5 methods from the total of 25 to be tested and add more tests as necessary. Once we have determined which methods to test, we will decide on the appropriate black-box test-case design techniques, such as equivalence classes and boundary conditions, to implement in our test cases.

# 4. How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Our teamwork plan was to split the work between four group members using the same methodology in Assignment 1. We did two groups of two and utilized pair testing to come up with the test design plan and the relevant test cases. One group was responsible for the Data Utilities Class and the corresponding test suite and the other group was responsible for the Range Class and the corresponding test suite.


# 5. Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Most of the difficulties encountered in this lab stemmed from designing the test cases with black box testing. It took time to try and understand the methods of black box test case design and how to test a method the best with the least amount of test cases. Overcoming this design challenge was accomplished by having a discussion and much contemplation between pair members. Another challenge overcome was to understand how to navigate through all the external jars and libraries. In this lab, our group learned how to design a test suite using black box testing methodology and how to design the least amount of test cases for the most results. It also took our group some time to understand the workings and utility of each of the discussed test methods (such as when to use equivalence partitioning and boundary analysis testing); to better our understanding, we thoroughly reviewed the lecture notes and made sure to understand the provided examples in order to determine when it is appropriate to use each test method.

# 6. Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The range class had a lot of functions but many getters and it does not seem reasonable to design many test cases around a getter function. We noticed that the getter method in the range class was not working as expected. Our group does not believe that in a working environment, we would encounter a broken getter method.
